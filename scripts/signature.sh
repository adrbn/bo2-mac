# signature.sh lift|link <mode> — fingerprint of the sources one step of a mode's conversion is made from; build_steam.sh
# keeps it in boot_cache/<mode>/.sig_lift and .sig_link. lift: what lifted.o is made of (lift, fold, the native bodies
# native_impl.sh joins to it), a change redoes the mode. link: what the link adds (runtime, shims), a change relinks
# (~1.5 min a mode).
# signature.sh check — status 1 if a mode up to boot_cache/conversion_target was made from other sources, was begun
# with signatures and not finished (an old boot may still be there), or was linked before the signatures, else 0.
# Left out: Remill and the exes. build_remill.sh only builds a missing Remill and install_steam.sh accepts one exact
# Steam build, so neither changes under an existing conversion.
